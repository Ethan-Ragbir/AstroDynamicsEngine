# AstroDynamicsEngine

A C++ simulation of gravitational interactions between multiple bodies, visualized in real-time using SFML.

## Description

This project simulates the motion of celestial bodies under the influence of gravity, using numerical integration methods. It’s a great example of applying physics and math concepts to a computational problem, making it both educational and visually engaging.

## Build

To build the project, you’ll need a C++ compiler and the SFML library installed. 

- **For Ubuntu**: Install SFML with:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev
